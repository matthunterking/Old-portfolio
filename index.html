                  <p class='projectText'>Using Node.js this project involved creating a full stack restaurant review site. My site Nibble, allowed users to add and review and comment on restaurants. This project was very challenging for me and I had to restart early on after a number of setbacks. However once I’d got back on track I was really pleased that I managed to make a functioning site and had time to include many of the additional features that I had planned. Although not my favourite project this was my first experience of building a website with both a front-end and backend and provided the foundation for future projects.

                  <p class='projectText'>For this project we were challenged to create a full stack web application using AngularJS. Working in a team with two other students (Ozzy and Steph) we produced a community jobs board called NeighbourGood. I was responsible for the creating the map elements using the Google Maps API and the filtering by distance feature which I created using MongoDB’s geolocation features. I also produced the back and front end automated tests and the styling of the site.

                  <p class='projectText'>The brief for this project was to create a full stack web application using React with the option to either work individually or as part of a team. I decided to work in group as I felt that we would be able to produce more than if we worked on our own and working with someone else would provide more opportunities for me to learn. We created a dating site called Destination Love which as well as being a traditional dating site would also solve the dilemma of deciding where to go on a date once you had matched with a potential partner. I primarily worked on the process for users to register, match and message each other as well as the styling. Initially I’d planned to use a third party package to manage the process of sending and accepting match requests however after running into difficulties decided it would be more fun and challenging to create my own system to manage theses requests.

      <article>
        <p>
          At the start of 2018 I decided that I needed to change careers and
          having had a professional life of always being the only person in the
          <br />
          office who knew how to work Microsoft Excel, decided that web
          development would be a good avenue to explore.
        </p>
         <p>
           After a couple of online courses I was hooked and decided to take a
           three month immersive course at General Assembly.
         </p>
         <p>
           Following my completion of the course I was asked to become part of
           the instructional team for the next two groups of students.
           <br />
           This gave me the opportunity to solidify my coding knowledge as
           well as coach and assist new students.
         </p>
         <p>
          Web development provides me with fresh and exciting challenges
          everyday and I love pushing myself to solve problems and learn new skills.
